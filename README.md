# Tasty Roots
MERN Family Recipe Sharing App - a tasty way to preserve family recipes and keep your roots alive!

- demo account: tasty@roots.com (tastyroots)

## About
Joined by their love of cooking and good food [Ruchita Sirkanungo](https://github.com/ruchitasir), [Sharon Lee](https://github.com/essleeung) and [Royce Ubando](https://github.com/royce-u) embarked on this journey to create a place to share recipes and keep their family traditions alive.

Tasty Roots is a community platform to connect families together and share recipes. Often after the passing of an older generation, the intricacies and measurements of a particular recipe may be debated or even lost. But fear no more- we have a feature for that! Twists can be added on recipes if you think your version is better. The application is deployed [here](http://tasty-roots-client.herokuapp.com/).

#### Technologies
This app was built with MongoDB, Express, React and Node, a sprinkle of Redux and utilizes JSON web tokens to authenticate users. Styling was done using React Semantic UI. The server side is deployed [here](http://tasty-roots-server.herokuapp.com/).

## Development Approach
Like any good team, a brainstorming session was immediately underway. For planning of this app, Balsmiq was utilized for basic wireframing, Trello for tracking progress on a kanban board and data schemas were designed with scalability in mind.

### User Profiles
Key features we wanted to implement included the following: 
- Ability for user to create recipes (add ingredients, steps and picture)
- Ability to create family circles and invite members to join
- Ability to choose who they share it with (keep private, publicly with entire community or just their family circle)
- Ability to make twists with recipes shared in user's family circle or broader community
